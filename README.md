# Enhancing Movie Recommendations: A Deep Dive into Collaborative Filtering

## Project Overview

The project, titled "Enhancing Movie Recommendations," represents the culmination of coursework for the subject Modern Analytics. The primary focus was on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enhance the movie recommendation process. Collaborative Filtering, facilitated by advanced NLP models, served as the core methodology for generating personalized movie recommendations.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
- **Similarity Measure:** Cosine Similarity

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to provide an advanced and personalized movie recommendation system. By delving into Collaborative Filtering techniques, the aim is to offer users tailored movie suggestions based on their preferences.

## Learning Outcomes

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Mastery of NLP techniques in the context of movie recommendations, including text analysis, sentiment analysis, and feature extraction.
2. **Collaborative Filtering:** In-depth understanding and application of collaborative filtering methodologies, including the use of cosine similarity for measuring user-item relationships.
